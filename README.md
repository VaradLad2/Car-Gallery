Car Showcase Gallery
Project Description
This is a simple web application that displays a gallery of cars. Users can browse through car models, view their descriptions and prices, and even manage the car listings by adding new cars, searching for specific models, and deleting existing ones.

This project is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content rendering.

Display of Car Gallery: Shows a grid of car products with images, names, descriptions, and prices.
Add New Car: Allows users to add new car listings to the gallery via a modal form.
Edit Car Details: Users can edit the details of existing cars by clicking on a car image, which opens a modal form pre-filled with the car's current information.
Delete Car Listings: Each car card has a "Delete" button to remove the car from the gallery.
Search Functionality: A search input field allows users to filter cars by model name.
Responsive Design: The gallery layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Visually Appealing Design: Utilizes a soft color palette and subtle styling to create a pleasant user experience.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the webpage content and elements.
CSS: For styling the webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
